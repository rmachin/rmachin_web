An internal blog used the right way can be a virtual bulletin board, communication tool and culture enhancement for your team or company. Plus, it's way better than tracking projects by e-mail.

# Keep all team up-to-date

An internal blog becomes an ideal and obvious place for all those small updates and provides a method of logging that information without the cumbersome process of constantly sending “update on topic” types of e-mails.

# Promote collaboration

A single blog post can easily turn into an active discussion around a topic. This helps you gauge where your team members stand on certain issues, as many people may be more likely to speak up virtually than face-to-face.
